Time travel is feat thought by most to be impossible. After all time travel is what many science fiction movies are made of. 
Let us not forget such movies as “Back to the Future” or “The Time Machine.” 
Yet unlike those movies time travel is not necessarily fiction. 
“We are in our own time machines, our hearts are pumping blood, 
we're breathing, we are existing through time (at least until our own personal time machines seriously malfunction).”
